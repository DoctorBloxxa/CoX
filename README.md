Run: `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoctorBloxxa/CoX/master/ui.luau", true))()`

This will load the library: 

`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoctorBloxxa/CoX/master/Core/CoX.luau", true))()`

Make sure to configure it though. I'll write documentation when it's mostly done.
